# Looking for a new Opportunity

Did you like my articles or Github repositories? I'm looking for a new opportunity to help modelling and building complex systems and to drive tech excellence.

- Already practicing Clean Code and Clean Architecture or looking for someone to enable this.
- Ideally no more PHP as primary language for me, I wan't to work with something else, ideally Java or C#.
- I'm looking for getting deeper into Java and Spring Boot.
- COBOL is something I would like to get in touch with as well.
- Legacy System modernization is something that is fun.
- My prefered industries would be Insurance, Banking, Governance, Healthcare and E-Commerce. But I'm open for almost everything.
- 100% remote work, though I'm very well willing to travel for workshops and other meaningful activities.
