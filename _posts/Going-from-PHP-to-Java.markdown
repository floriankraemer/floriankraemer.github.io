## What is new? 

Probably mostly concepts like AOP and Optionals.

## Libraries

When transitioning from one ecosystem of a language into another everyone would like to use similar tools and capabilities.

## Package Management

PHP features just the Composer Package Manager, Java already has two: Maven (XML based config) and Gradle (Kotlin based config).

If you have worked with Symfony, you'll realize that Symfony was probably influenced A LOT by Spring Boot.

## AOP - Aspect Oriented Programming

While there exist some AOP libraries for PHP, because of the way PHP works, it is not that easy to achieve a nice AOP implementation in PHP. AOP in PHP is therefore not really widespread.

So when moving from PHP to Java, especially Spring, it will be crucial to understand the concept of AOP.
