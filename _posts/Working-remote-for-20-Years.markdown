# Working remote for 20 years

This is my experience after working 20 years remote and the need to find a new remote job.

I'm living on the country side and enjoy almost all aspects of it, the slower internet compared to cities and that you have to travel 5-20min when you want to do some errands or see a doctor is probably considered negative for some. Here are also no bigger IT companies near my location. The next bigger cities, Kassel and Göttingen, are depending on where exactly you have to go, and the traffic conditions, roughly 1 to 1.5h away from me.

## Your travel time is not free time

### The social aspect for the employee

The german state considers a travel of up to 2.5 hours (one way!) to your workplace as "acceptable". The time spend there is also considered "free time" and not "work time". While this definition might work for some people, other people, including me, will strongly disagree. It is also funny that that the german state has quiet strong laws regarding how long you should work, but spending 2.5h in an often stressful traffic environment seems to bother the same people not very much.

The best you can do in a car is probably listen to audio books or audio tutorials and not everybody enjoys that. If you want to spend your time with your family or being active, you simply can not do this in your car or train. On top of that, there are unknown factors like traffic jams or the notoriously unpunctual Deutsche Bahn (German Train company) and not to mention the joy of public transport in some bigger cities, with all the unwanted social encounters and smells.

I have doubts that whatever pen-pusher came up with that number was **ever** in the situation to have to work for 8h plus **spending 5h on the road** and getting his private life, like shopping groceries and doing the household done. It is unrealistic and in my opinion against modern work ethics. This feels like a step back into the 19th century.

### The financial aspect for the employee

Consider that you have to drive just ~1 hour and ~50km to your workplace. The average days of work per month is 21. That means you'll spend 42 hours per week and 2100km per month on the road. The price in just fuel (Diesel) for that is 178,50€ assuming a consumption of 5 liters per 100km and as of today, a price of 1.70€ per liter. 42h compensated by the minimum required salary in Germany (12.41€ per hour in 2024) means you'll miss 521,22€. So, you have wasted 42h of your life without getting a compensation for that, but instead you even spent ~180€ on top of that.

If you don't have to drive that you get a lot of time with your family or your hobbies back. But the home office has a few negative sides as well: You'll have to pay the energy costs for powering your devices and the 8-10h additional heating when it is winter, because you're now at home all the time. You'll spend the energy for your hardware and everything else you will consume while being at home, like water.

### The finance aspect for the employer

One of the companies I worked for ran into trouble because of the corona pandemic in 2009 as many other companies as well. As the result of the pandemic the office was resolved and instead a shared office space is now rented on demand. This turned out to be cheaper for the company as well and more people, who worked usually on site, could now stay at home.

## Remote work is green work

When the Corona pandemic forced a lot people to work from home it was an opportunity for science to figure out what the actual impact of remote work on the environment regarding carbon dioxide emissions is and how severe it is.

> The study found that people who work remotely four or more days a week can reduce their carbon footprint by up to 54 percent, and those who do so up to four days a week can reduce it by up to 29. But these reductions only hold if workers implement strategies such as turning off unnecessary lights and appliances, driving an electric vehicle or sourcing their home electricity from solar panels or wind turbines.

> With the daily commute all but cancelled during successive Covid-19 lockdowns, many have assumed that WFH will lead to environmental sustainability gains. Indeed, such dramatic changes in mobility, production, and consumption patterns, temporarily reduced global CO2 emissions by 17% in April 2020 compared to peak 2019 levels. But what seemed like a promising trend soon faded away: emissions are now almost back at pre-pandemic levels, even as employees aren’t.

Because of the environmental impact, and the advantages for the employer and employees, the state should actually push companies to enable remote work wherever it is possible. By doing so I see almost only winners, the only losers would be those companies or managers who want to exercise power and control on site over their employees for some reason.

## The impact on productivity

> [A study by Standford](https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4746/f/wfh.pdf) of 16,000 workers over 9 months found that working from home increase productivity by 13%. This increase in performance was due to more calls per minute attributed to a quieter more convenient working environment and working more minutes per shift because of fewer breaks and sick days.

> In this same study workers also reported improved work satisfaction, and attrition rates were cut by 50%.

## Trust or the lack of

If I'm allowed to work two or three days from home, why do I have to get into the office for the other days?

Don't get me wrong, there are certain activities, like Event Stormings and similar workshops and meetings that *should* be done in person, for the social factor, but they are the exception and not the norm.

Meaningless presence in the office is a kind of meaningless control, implying a lack of trust in the employees.

I would rather work 10h, doing meaningful work, than spending those two additional hours on the road, because doing something meaningful is fun and if it is work, you'll get compensated for it. While traveling, especially by car, is just a waste of time and money.

I find it rather strange that the expectation is that you can have more control over your employees being productive on site than remote. If you aren't a control freak nobody will stay behind the workers and check if they are lazy at work. And secret monitoring software is at least in germany thankfully forbidden.

My personal observation was that especially traditional companies and companies that are not working primarily in the IT sector aren't very open to remote work and demand at least a hybrid model.

## Conclusion

Finding a good place to work remote is still not that easy, therefore I'm very happy to call myself lucky.

Regarding the environmental impact, and the advantages for the employer and employees, the state should actually push companies to enable remote work wherever it is possible. By doing so I see almost only winners, the only losers would be those companies or managers who want to exercise power and control on site over their employees for some reason.
