## Domain Layer Services

1. Domain Logic Focus:
   * **Purpose:** Domain layer services are primarily concerned with encapsulating and implementing the core business logic of the application.
   * **Domain Entities:** These services often operate on domain entities, which represent the core concepts and rules of the business domain.
2. Business Rules Implementation:
   * **Responsibility:** Domain layer services implement and enforce the business rules and constraints specific to the domain.
   * **Isolation of Logic:** They encapsulate the core business logic to maintain a clean and understandable domain model.
3. Domain Model Interaction:
   * **Interaction with Entities:** Domain services frequently interact with domain entities to perform operations and maintain the consistency of the domain model.
   * **Aggregates:** Services might work with aggregates or aggregates roots, ensuring that operations maintain the integrity of the domain state.
4. Domain Events:
   * **Event Handling:** Domain services may handle domain events, reacting to changes in the domain entities and triggering further actions.
5. Domain-specific Language:
   * **Ubiquitous Language:** Domain layer services use the ubiquitous language of the business domain, aiming to closely mirror the terminology and concepts used by domain experts.

## Application Layer Services

1. Application Flow and Coordination:
   * **Purpose:** Application layer services are responsible for coordinating the flow of the application, handling input, and orchestrating interactions between the domain layer and external components.
2. Transaction Management:
   * **Transactional Boundaries:** Application services define transactional boundaries, ensuring that multiple operations can be grouped together within a single transaction.
3. Use Case Implementation:
   * **Use Case Logic:** Application services implement specific use cases or application features, orchestrating the steps needed to fulfill user requests or system operations.
   * **Interfacing with Domain Services:** They often interact with domain layer services to accomplish use case goals.
4. External Interfaces:
   * **Interaction with External Systems:** Application services may handle interactions with external systems, such as databases, external APIs, or user interfaces.
   * **Input/Output Handling:** They are responsible for handling input from external sources and providing output.
5. Error Handling and Logging:
   * **Error Handling:** Application services handle errors and exceptions, translating them into meaningful responses or logging them for further analysis.
   * **Logging:** They may log relevant information for debugging and auditing purposes.
6. Security and Authorization:
   * **Authorization:** Application services often enforce authorization rules and security measures, ensuring that users have the necessary permissions for specific actions.

## The Relationship between them

So, what is the actuall relationship between them?

**Collaboration:** Application services collaborate with domain services to achieve overall system functionality. They act as an interface between the user interface, external systems, and the domain layer.

**Separation of Concerns:** The distinction between domain layer services and application layer services adheres to the principle of separation of concerns, promoting a modular and maintainable architecture.

In summary, while domain layer services focus on encapsulating the core business logic and rules, application layer services concentrate on coordinating the flow of the application, handling external interfaces, and managing use cases. Both layers work together to create a well-structured and maintainable software architecture.
