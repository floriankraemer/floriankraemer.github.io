SpaceX just lunched their 3rd prototype of their space ship.

* [1] Apollo would cost $164 billion today.
* [3] Depending on the source, Starship costs range from $2-10 billion.
* [3] A spaceship launch costs approximately ~1.3% of the average NASA launch cost - $152 million.

NASA, being a bureaucratic organization, is also entangled with politics. While SpaceX aims for in-house production, NASA projects involve numerous suppliers across states due to their high system complexity. This is desired by politics but makes processes bulkier and slower. This might be why NASA can't execute rapid iterative processes. NASA can afford this due to taxpayer funding. :)

An engineer's craftsmanship is to make scientific findings practically usable. But this includes in my opinion being cost-conscious as well. It is like software developers who prefer developing super fancy abstractions when a "dirty" script could suffice to demonstrate a functionality and already delivery value, instead of craving for perfectionism but failing to deliver while generating a lot costs.

Are you familiar with the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)? If I want to deliver a product without tests, I need to achieve not just 80% but 100%, consuming 80% of the time. Not using real prototypes and being unable to test the entire system will yield less insight than multiple quick prototypes.

Personally, I believe SpaceX's iterative approach is superior. This applies to software and business value as well. I could wait five times longer to sell something, or I could sell a means of transportation from the MVP stage.
