For more than a decade, I published software under the MIT license and contributed to the development of the CakePHP framework. Over all those years, I received about €200 in donations—money I passed directly on to Khan Academy. I never did it for the money, but it gives a realistic picture of what “financial support” often looks like in practice for many open source projects, even some popular ones.

What I did receive, however, were sometimes very unpleasant, demanding requests to “Just quickly implement feature X!” of course for free, in my spare time. Excuse me? This very attitude, this entrenched expectation, that everything must be free is one of the main reasons I eventually stepped away from private open-source engagement.

Do you remember Heartbleed? The OpenSSL library was affecte software used by everyone: Amazon, Google, Apple. And yet, no one of them had invested the relatively small amount of money required for a proper security audit or consistent developer support. Seriously? That is not how you should treat something very valuable provided for free, that you use as a foundational element in your infrastructure.

No, just because it is provided for free doesn't mean the software has no cost, it has the production cost which I paid with my free time. **You have no right to demand anything.** This is literally in the license. You urgently need something, that I provided until now for free for you? Great, pay for the service and be polite.

If you like a product, pay for it or donate. Or choose an alternative that is free of any cost, but don't complain about missing features or anything else. The constant complaining that everything must be free has become deeply frustrating to me, given this history.

Alternatively, you can contact the vendor, provide documentation proving non-profit status, and—with a bit of luck—receive a license that way. Asking costs nothing.
