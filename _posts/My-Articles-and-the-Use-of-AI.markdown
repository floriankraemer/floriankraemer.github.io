There is a flood of poor and similar AI generated articles these days. You can't always be sure something is AI generated but you probably got a feeling for it if you search for information and stumble across the same pattern of articles over and over. One characteristic of them is usually a lack of personality in my opinion and often a profound lack of depth.

I'm pretty sure you can get well written articles from an AI, but this requires you to already have a deep understanding of the topic to steer it to write the article in a direction that generates value for the reader and aligns with your intention to express a certain point regarding the topic.

**I write my articles on my own, I do my own research.** The source of the articles are usually things I've encountered during career, in the past or recently, that I find worthwhile to share with you. I like to share my experience and knowledge. And the articles are also a testament and reference of my experience and skills or the absence of such, I leave that judgement up to you.

I use AI to correct grammar and mistakes or to rephrase sentences that, as a non-native English speaker, I can't always express as eloquently as I'd like to.

Sometimes I use AI to generate tabular data, because it is annoying to write tables in Markdown for my articles.

I let the AI review my articles based on a prompt that lets it review it based on different readers roles and skill level and rate it on a scale from 1 to 5. I let it make suggestions about restructuring and to give me an assessment of what it "thinks" about the quality of the article. This isn't perfect either but I see it as a kind of critical peer-reviewer, that sometimes made me add another paragraph or two because it pointed something out that was indeed useful to mention but missing. The content I produce to fill that gap is my own. I'm not generating those missing parts.

You can use AI perfectly as a strong reviewer and sometimes even as a kind of co-author or coach, but it won't write whole outstanding and unique articles that reflect your personality. **You** will have to put some effort into this.

In an age of automation, the human touch still matters. That’s what I aim to offer here by being myself and not letting an AI write for me. Sorry — you’ll have to live with my occasionally edgy phrasing.
