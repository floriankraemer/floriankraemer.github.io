## Types of Documentation

### Architectural Documentation

Architectural documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the system's structure, components, and interactions. It outlines the design decisions, patterns, and principles guiding the development of the software architecture. This documentation serves as a roadmap for developers, guiding them in implementing and maintaining the system. It typically includes architectural diagrams, component descriptions, design rationale, and key interfaces.

### Development Documentation

Development documentation encompasses all materials necessary for software developers to understand, modify, and extend the codebase efficiently. It includes code comments, inline documentation, coding standards, and guidelines. This documentation aids developers in comprehending the logic behind the code, its intended functionality, and how different modules integrate with each other. It promotes consistency, collaboration, and maintainability across the development team.

### End User Documentation

End user documentation is tailored for the system's end users, providing guidance on how to effectively use the software to accomplish their tasks. It includes user manuals, guides, tutorials, and FAQs designed to facilitate a smooth user experience. End user documentation aims to empower users with the knowledge and skills needed to leverage the software's features optimally. Clear instructions, illustrations, and examples are essential components of effective end user documentation.

### Testing Documentation

Testing documentation documents the testing strategy, test cases, test plans, and test results used to verify and validate the software's functionality, performance, and reliability. It ensures that the software meets the specified requirements and quality standards before deployment.

### Release Documentation

Release documentation documents the changes, enhancements, bug fixes, and new features included in each software release. It provides release notes, version history, and upgrade instructions to help users and administrators understand what has changed and how to transition to the new version smoothly.

### Compliance Documentation

Compliance documentation ensures that the software complies with industry regulations, standards, and legal requirements. It includes certifications, audit reports, security assessments, and privacy policies that demonstrate the software's adherence to relevant compliance standards.

## Measuring the impact of the (absence of) documentation

The impact of the absence of good documentation can manifest in various ways, affecting different aspects of the software development process and the product itself.

However, it is not possible to measure the impact directly, only indirect through changes in behavior of the involved people or related metrics.

Feedback from Stakeholders: Feedback from stakeholders, including developers, users, and project managers, can provide valuable insights into the impact of documentation. Surveys, interviews, and feedback forms can be used to gather qualitative data on the challenges and issues caused by inadequate documentation.

Onboarding time to productivity: Good documentation can improve the time of the onboarding for internal and external stakeholders and it is measurable. For example the time it takes a developer to create a new component confidently and with good quality can be measured.

## Improving documentation

* Make it easy to report issues within the documentation.
* Make it easy to improve and contribute to the documentation.
* Link your documentation in related documents and code.
