*To be very clear, right from the beginning: I'm not blaming anyone for anything on this article!* The goal of the article is to hopefully trigger a discussion that leads to some actions and results.

## Has the software industry an education problem?

Why do we encounter recurrently whole teams that have never heard of certain concepts that aren't often even overly complex when explained properly?

Why do universities favour often very abstract things over real-world, everyday programming techniques and problems that would improve the ability to write high quality code on their own? Why do we have graduates who have never heard about the SOLID principles? Especially when there are studies [1][2] in computer science that prove them to be valuable.

## Has the software industry a problem?

We have to consider that the software industry, or to be more specific, software engineering is a very young discipline compared to classic mechanical engineering and (building) architecture. Therefore we don't have the decades and centuries of experience other professions already gained. On the other hand, software is today as ubiquitous as cars, mobile phones and other goods of our daily live, which are meanwhile almost all running software.

What does engineering actually means? Engineering is the application and practical use of science. It is the result of research and discoveries that lead to knowledge or concrete artifacts that can be used as a commodity in engineering.

Despite being a young but ubiquitous profession, there has already been done a lot of research in the area of computer science. We already know a lot things on how to build software or how software should be built, tested and deployed.

So is there a problem with knowledge transfer? Does the academic field when it trains new students have a completely different perception of the reality of what is going on in the real world? Are companies aware of that?

The following areas are usually the ones with the biggest deficits:

* [System Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking)
* Testing
* Refactoring
* Design Principles (like SOLID)
* Design Patterns

Why is that so?

## Framework-Developers

After I started writing this article I came across this amazing quote on Twitter/X:

![Quote from Oliver Zihler](/assets/images/screenshots/oliver-zihler-quote.jpg){: .align-center}

A good software developer can apply those concepts and techniques within **any** framework. Learning a framework for the regular every day usage is nothing extraordinary and hard to master. It is just remembering an API and to follow some conventions. It's a repetitive exercise until you remember the necessary things. If you understand patterns you'll be also quicker in getting into the different frameworks.

Writing clean and maintainable code, being aware of best practices and principles, good testing skills, all of this contributes much more to good software than knowing a framework. It is fair that they want somebody who knows a framework, because the perception is that his person will be quickly able to start working. Yes, this is very likely true, but will this person contribute to improve the system or just continue the status quo?

In my opinion, companies looking for good developers, should ask for the before mentioned areas and only then for the framework.

It is interesting how many developers don't know or try to find reasons to not use fundamental and proven principles in our industry.

Every profession has chores, there will be always tasks that are no fun or at least not fun for many while others might even like them. Testing is probably an infamous example for that.

I do not think that the ability to use an arbitrary programming language actually enables somebody to properly write software. Anyone who can write in a given language understands the grammar and words, but not everybody will be able to write elegant, well formulated, yet understandable sentences. If you do not plan to become a professional writer, author or bard, the lack of these skills is totally fine and not needed.

I really do not like the idea of considering developers as "code monkeys", the industry and education system needs to enable them accordingly to be more than just code producing "code monkeys" that need an accurate plan, class diagram, to build a system that fulfills certain quality attributes.

Some people want to write just code. This is perfectly fine if you do it for fun and do not plan to show your code as reference during a job interview. In an environment that has a decent level of quality and best practice expectations, this mindset is not working any longer.

Tests are a fundamental part of the profession, design principles don't exist for fun but to solve certain, recurring problems. They've got their names so we are able to communicate the solution with a simple name instead of explaining a whole concept.

It would probably be fun to have a programming language that actually enforces tests to compile.

It should be in the very interest of every entity that has the goal to earn money with software to deliver quickly and to deliver high quality. Therefore any business should be interested in proper development processes, use of principles, design patterns and testing procedures.

## How do you motivate people to intrinsically get used to those concepts?
