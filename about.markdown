Hey, Iâ€™m Florian KrÃ¤mer.

Iâ€™m a software developer and software architect. I started coding in 2000 and specialize in building web apps, primarily with PHP or whatever I can get my hands on, recently exploring Java and Spring.

Take a look at [my CV](assets/files/cv-florian-kraemer.pdf) for more details about my professional accomplishments.

Email me at <a href="mailto:contact@floriankraemer.net">contact@floriankraemer.net<a/>.

Let's connect and explore how my skills and knowledge can contribute to the success of your projects.

* I'm intrinsically motivated, I love my profession and technology.
* Understanding new businesses and domains is something I like, I'm curious by nature.
* I like to learn new things.
* DDD - Domain Driven Design. Communication and processes that ultimately manifests in great code is what I like and believe in without being dogmatic.
* Being an architect is more than technology - teams, people and social interactions are part of the process.
* I like to refactor legacy systems if I get the opportunity to do so.
* SOLID, YAGNI - Concepts that create good code.
* Frameworks are just tools, I'm not dogmatic about them.
* While I'm proficient in PHP, I would love to work on c# and Java related projects as well.
* Artificial intelligence ðŸ¤–, neural networks - super interesting.
* I'm grateful to anyone who gave and will give me chance to grow. ðŸ™‡
