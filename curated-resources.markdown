## Libraries

Those are the selection criterias for the libraries:

* Should have no further dependencies at all if possible, the fewer the better.
* It must do just one thing and do it right instead of many (SRP).
* Should be at least PHP 7.1 or greater.
* Must have tests.
* PSR2 and PSR12 is prefered.
